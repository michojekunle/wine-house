## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

In the course of this Project as Interesting and Refreshing as it was, I grabbed a few Important concepts such as:
- Effectively Building Responsive websites and apps with vanilla css.
- 

### Continued development
```
Going forward, I'll be working on more animated, responsive, dynamic and interactive websites with vanilla CSS and other CSS & JS Libraries.
```
